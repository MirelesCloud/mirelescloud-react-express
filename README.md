## Summary  

Basic react app with express api.  Based on https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0  

The backend of the project proxies inside client/package.json using `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000/"`
Key is to move all react boilerplate folders and files (public, src, package.json, node_modules) into client folder.  Note that there are two package.json files and two node_modules files.

### Install and run  

npm install nodemon -g  
yarn  
cd client  
yarn  
yarn dev
